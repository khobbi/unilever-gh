            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Unilever was established in Ghana between 1928-1931 as the United African Company
                (UAC) out of two main companies, the Lever Brothers' Company and the African and 
                Eastern Trade Corporation. The Lever factory was built in 1963. The UAC was absorbed 
                into its parent company Unilever to form Unilever Ghana Limited in 1992. It had initially 
                been operating as a trading company but later shifted to manufacturing. Currently, Unilever 
                PLC owns 66,7% of Unilever Ghana. The company's business in Ghana comprises the manufacturing 
                and distribution of food products (cooking oil, spices, iodised salt, etc.), home care products 
                (soaps and detergents) and personal care products (body, hair and oral care products). The company's 
                head office and factory are in Tema, near Accra. </p>
